Pilot project objectives: 1) construct a relational database and build an informative interface that incorporates historical prescription of Medicare transaction, psychotropic drug, corresponding diagnoses and patientâ€™s reviews of psychotropic drugs.
2) Combine FDA drug label information, patient drug reviews, Medicare FFS parts b and d provider utilization and payment data sets, as well as hospital information and review.
3) Gather data using API and scraping methods (R, Python). 
4) Apply sentiment analysis on drug reviews.
5) Use interface to evaluate hypotheses (i.e., understand prescribing and practice trends both at the physician level and understand geographic trends).
6) Summarize from the connection between related information including geographic location, NPI (provider identifier), drug, diagnosis, cost, review for professionals to extrapolate business, epidemiology and medical insights ranging from nationwide to individual level.
7) Visualize results using Tableau.
